## PPIE Materials for AI literacy 
Much of my worked is centred around working with members of the public on AI topics, co-creating educational materials around AI, and thinking about critical AI literacy. Below are some useful resources I have used in different public and patient involvement and engagement (PPIE) groups to prompt discussion around AI and to grow critical AI literacy. 

**Facial Recognition:** 
How Normal Am I? This tool allows users to experience a facial recognition tool, by sharing access to their webcam an AI tool rates your face, predicting your age, BMI and attractiveness. This is a useful starting point for wider conversations about what facial recognition is useful, and not useful for, the subjectivity of many measures such as attractiveness, and how easy it is to manipulate if you change the lighting, smile, or put on a hat. No personal data is stored. https://www.hownormalami.eu/

**Classification**
Teachable Machine, provided by Google, is a quick and easy way to show people how classification models work. You can upload images and the model will train a simple classification model. I use this to demostrate how important the data input is, and the potential for bias given different features, for example if you train a model on classifying cats and dogs, but only inlcude blonde labradors, the model is much worse at identifying black labradors. https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/
